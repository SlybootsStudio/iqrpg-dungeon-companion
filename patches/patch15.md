Labyrinth
---------

- The Labyrinth is a daily activity which you can enter for 100 actions initially - there may be a way to increase these actions in the future.
- The Labyrinth consists of a randomly generated set of rooms which use your existing skill levels to make progress.
- Once completing the Labyrinth, you can open the "Labyrinth Reward Chest" which contains a number of items depending on how far you progressed.
- The minimum reward is 1 item, but an additional item is added for each room you pass after room 5.
- There are 3 drop-tables. Low, medium and high. The further you progress in the Labyrinth, the fewer times you will hit the low drop-table.
- All rewards are scaled based on your currently skill levels. Rewards are subject to change and new rewards will be added/removed in future patches.
- The Labyrinth will be expanded on in future patches.

Items
-----

- Added "Artisan Shards" that are given when collecting the Labyrinth Reward Chest. These will be used for an upgrade that boosts exp/gold/res and possibly more.
- Added "Alchemical Dust" which will be used to make Crafting Haste Potions.
- These two items will be released with the next patch (very soon) once I determine how many of these are actually dropping, and how much they should cost.

Battling
--------

- Increased the amount of gold that mobs drop in the first 3 areas.
- The level bonus applied to gold gained from battling was increased.
- Significantly increased the rate which lower level players gain health, attack and defence.
- The battling drop-tables were buffed slightly. These changes are not yet reflected in the in-game drop-table.

Events
---------

- Base resources from gathering events increased. Decreased resources from levels. Overall, significant buff for lower level gatherers, smaller buff for higher level gatherers.
- Exp from common and uncommon gathering events increased from 50%/100% to 100%/125%.
- Slightly increased the amount of gold given from excess damage after boss damage throttling.

Crafting
--------

- Sapphires now give 70 base exp per attempt, up from 65.

Raids
-----

- Increased the chances of getting a Master Alchemist's Hut raid by 10%.
- Increased the chances of getting a Large Bank raid by 25%.

Misc
----

- Clanmanship mastery level is now shown in the clan members section.
- Clans no longer receive chat notifications about mob spawns in the battlegrounds.
- It now costs a flat 50 Credits to reset your premium boosts.

Land

Bugs
----

- Fixed the blank screen when clicking "back" that sometimes occurred on the market.
